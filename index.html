Fuckers in school telling me, always in the barber shop
"Chief Keef ain't 'bout this, Chief Keef ain't 'bout that"
My boy a BD on fucking Lamron and them
He, he, they say that nigga don't be putting in no work
Shut the fuck up
Y'all niggas ain't know shit
All y'all motherfuckers talkin' about
"Chief Keef ain't no hitter
Chief Keef ain't this
Chief Keef a fake"
Shut the fuck up
Y'all don't live with that nigga
Y'all know that nigga got caught with a ratchet
Shootin' at the police and shit
Nigga been on probation since fuckin' I don't know when
Motherfucker, stop fuckin' playin' him like that
Them niggas savages out there
If I catch another motherfucker talking sweet about Chief Keef
I'm fucking beatin' they ass
I'm not fucking playin' no more
Y'all know them niggas roll with Lil Reese and them
(Young Chop on the beat)
